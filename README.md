# Salesforce Programmable Wallets

![](https://github.com/MuKnSys/web3-wallet-for-salesforce/blob/main/documentation-and-images/Web3-wallet-for-Salesforce-logo.png)

Programmable Wallets for Salesforce, powered by Circle programmable wallets, is an open source solution built on Circle Programmable Wallet technology to operating 100% within the Salesfore Ecosystem.

Key management is abstracted as Developer Managed Wallets, using Salesforce permissions to manage wallet safety. The company will be able to grant read, write, and execute permissions on the Web3 assets without leaving the environment they are comfortable with.

## Status of Project

### Milestone 1 - Setup Project

The initial Setup App and Screen is built. It allows you to connect to the Programmable wallet system.

This Open Source project requires you to register a developer key. This will be clarified in Milestone 3 as we prepare for final release. We are able to connect to the developer account. All "scaffolding is done."

For an explanation of the screen, please view [Milestone 1 Explainer Video](https://youtu.be/XJlX5Affdg8)

### Milestone 2 - Wallet Sets, Wallets, etc.

Milestone 2 demostrates the creation of Wallet Sets, Wallets of both types, and them showing up on the Circle Console. Milestone 3 was created contemporanously to Milestone 3.

## Ssalesforce DX Project Setup Information

This is a basic demonstration Salesforce DX Project. Using the
[SF CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) tools, you can deploy
to a Developer Edition Scratch Org.

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some
documentation resources to get you started.

## Salesforce Developer Edition

You can get a free Salesforce Developer Edition account from Salesforce. Sign up
at:

https://developer.salesforce.com/signup

## How To Test the App - Using Repository

1. Clone the repository.
1. Checkout the main branch.
1. Log into the Dev Hub Org by running
   `sf org login web --set-default-dev-hub --alias DevHub --instance-url https://login.salesforce.com`
   and entering your username and password.
1. Create a Scratch Org by running
   `sf org create scratch -f ./config/project-scratch-def.json -a dev -d -y 30`.
   - The `-f` flag is a path to config file (no need to change it).
   - The `-a` flag is an alias of the scratch org, if you create multiple
     scratch orgs you can give them unique aliases to easier refer to them.
   - The `-d` flag marks the newly created scratch org as default. If you don't
     mark it as default you will have to reference it by username or alias, or
     you will have to use `sf config set target-org YourAliasOrUsername` to set
     is as default.
   - The `-y` flag sets the number of days before the org expires.
   - Use the `-h` flag for help.
   - For more details:
     [developer docs scratch orgs create](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_scratch_orgs_create.htm).
1. Push the code to the Scratch Org: `sf project deploy start`
1. Connect to the Salesforce Scratch Org: `sf org open`
